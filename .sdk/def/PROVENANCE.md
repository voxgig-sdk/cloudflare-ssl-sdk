Cloudflare publishes one monolithic definition spanning many independent products.
This repository covers the named product surface, not the entire Cloudflare
platform. The product split is reproducible with
`voxgig-sdk/admin/scripts/cloudflare-split.py`; it retains every transitively
referenced OpenAPI component, rejects no operation within its declared path
families, and assigns no path to more than one product SDK.
