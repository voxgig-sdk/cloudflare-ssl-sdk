Cloudflare publishes one monolithic definition spanning many independent products.
This repository covers the named product surface. Together, the 34 Cloudflare
SDK repositories cover all 2,260 paths and 3,605 operations in the source
definition exactly once. The product split is reproducible with
`voxgig-sdk/admin/scripts/cloudflare-split.py`; it retains every transitively
referenced OpenAPI component, rejects no operation within its declared path
families, and assigns no path to more than one product SDK.
